# RosettaRoverTeam1


Ok, so read this if you need some help navigating through the code :p


You can see 4 main folders, I will explain what each folder has in it:

-Base:
	-The main code, currently using the new sensor to move and follow the line. Look in the code to find out which pins what sensor needs to be connected to!

-BaseOld
	- The backup, or the code that used the old sensors to follow the line. Just in case!

-DistanceMove
	- This is a test code to see how to encoders work and see the code how to use them. Its putting them in array and checking the encoders over time. It measures the speed of the wheels. Put the encoders in the motor shield and leave them there


-RemoveMove
	- The old code that we used to move the rover using manual control from my bluetooth computer. Not much use at this moment but good to look at if something is missing!


Thats all of them. Be careful not the break any sensors and msg me if you need help!
Gjosse :p
